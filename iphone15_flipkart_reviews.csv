The cameras are obviously better. The Dynamic Island is alright but not something I cannot live without. Face ID works smoother.I am not into games, so no comments on that. For a regular person, this phone is more than enough. And for people with other Apple devices, this is just an awesome part of the ecosystem.READ MORE"

Dipin Kapoor,4,"I am an iphone user since long. I have bought this YELLOW colour. But really feel that apple should rethink and rename this colour as GOLDEN YELLOW, its edges are slightly on the Golden side as you can see in the pics. Additional feature as compare to iphone 13, this has Dynamic Island and camera is superb 👌🏻 I am using it for 5 hrs daily, not facing any heating issue as such.READ MORE"

Amiya Roy,5,"Upgraded from Iphone 11. worth buying it. here are some pros and cons.Pros:1) Smooth, constant software update,2)6 GB RAM,1 day easily sustainable battery life3) extremely helpful if you are in apple ecosystem.4) 48MP camera is really great if we compare  with my I Phone 11's 12 MP .Best video quality.5) don't go for 15 plus or pro model even if you have enough money. but 128 GB base model within 65000 RS and use that extra money to buy MacBook AIR or airpod 3rd GEN.CONS:1) 60HZ disp...READ MORE"

Pinaki Ray,4,"Well, there is a little bit of hitting issue there, not at charging but in general operations. From design perspective, dynamic island is horribly thick for a 6.1 screen. It could have been smarter if the look was a little bit slim. What stops apple to increase the battery capacity now a days is beyond explanation. The Chinese manufacturers has definitely done a phenomenal job in terms of both the battery and charging. There's no trade Off there, it's a success for them. In software, the comp...READ MORE"

Kumar Patel,4,"A Mixed Bag of BrillianceThe iPhone 15 flaunts an impressive camera setup, capturing moments with exceptional clarity and detail.

Deb Neogi,5,"At the time of sale it was the best deal for me , intented to buy pixel 8 but went for iphone 15 was really worth it . Performance user experience camera design is undoubtedly excellent the only drawback is the battery life , which sustains for only 6 7 hours and in daily life have to charge 2 times . As a flagship phone it could be a better but noting is perfect, without the battery issue in every aspect it is value for money.READ MORE"
